## Question 1
Write a shell script that does the following:
1. Create a directory called "hw1_unix".  
2. Copy the "hw1_unix" directory to another directory called "hw1_unix_copy".  
3. Create an empty file in "hw1_unix_copy" called "file1.txt".
4. Copy the file to "hw1_unix" and rename it "file1_copy.txt".
5. Repeat step 4 except name the file "file1_copy2.txt".
6. List out the directories created.
7. List out the files in the "hw1_unix" directory.

Hint: "../" goes back one directory

How to run the script:  
chmod 777 question1.sh 
./question1.sh

Output:
hw1_unix/  hw1_unix_copy/
file1_copy.txt  file1_copy2.txt
